# Chaos Website

## RANDOM
## Try It Out

Just open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How It Works

The website uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic, interactive experience:
- Random element generation and transformation
- Particle system with physics
- Smart visibility control to ensure there's always something to see
- Multiple layers of randomness in movements and effects
